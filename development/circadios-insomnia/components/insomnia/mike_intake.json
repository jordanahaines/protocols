You are to rate the chance that you would doze off or fall asleep during different routine daytime situations. Answers to the questions are rated on a reliable scale called the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Each item is rated from 0 to 3, with 0 meaning you would never doze or fall asleep in a given situation, and 3 meaning there is a very high chance that you would doze or fall asleep in that situation. \nHow likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations, in contrast to just feeling tired? Even if you haven’t done some of the activities recently, think about how they would have affected you. \nUse this scale to choose the most appropriate number for each situation: \n0 = would never doze\n1 = slight chance of dozing\n2 = moderate chance of dozing  \n3 = high chance of dozing\n\nIt is important that you select a number (0 to 3) for EACH situation.",
