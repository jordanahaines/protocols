			h2 What is Obstructive Sleep Apnea?
			p Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a medical condition which occurs during sleep produced by obstruction of airflow through your nose and throat. The obstruction results in a reduction or complete obstruction of airflow and results in decreased oxygen (known as hypoxia) being delivered to your body. As a response to the hypoxia and in order to re-open the airway, the brain signals your body to increase muscle tone in your airway. This pattern of hypoxia and the body’s response to open the airway interrupts your normal sleep pattern. The combination of a lack of normal oxygen and interrupted sleep pattern may lead to several medical problems.
			p Obstructive sleep apnea is classified based on the number of episodes of alterations in your breathing. A decrease in airflow is known as hypopnea and a complete obstruction is an apnea. The number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour determines the severity of your sleep apnea.
			p Mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea is defined as 5 to 15 episodes of apnea/hypopnea in 1 hour. There are several signs which are monitored during your sleep study. These include heart rate, oxygen level and overall sleep pattern.
			p Your sleep study indicates you have mild obstructive sleep apnea. Symptoms of mild obstructive sleep apnea include:

					a(href="https://www.circadios.com/snoring") Snoring
				li Awakening during the night
				li Daytime fatigue
				li Lack of energy
				li Morning headache
				li Decreased sex drive
				li Lack of mental focus or brain fog
				li High blood pressure
				li Abnormal heart rate
			p Obstructive Sleep Apnea may contribute to heart problems.
			p We recommend discussing a cardiology evaluation with your primary care physician.
			p There are several treatment options for your mild obstructive sleep apnea.
			p A combination of lifestyle and sleep hygiene measures may be sufficient to treat your sleep apnea. In addition to lifestyle and sleep hygiene, addressing causes of airway obstruction such as nasal obstruction may be helpful. In other cases, we may recommend an oral appliance or positive airway pressure (pap) device known as an automatic pap (apap). We are starting with adjustments to your lifestyle and sleep hygiene.
			p We are starting with adjustments to your lifestyle and sleep hygiene in combination with oral appliance therapy (OAT).
			h2 Oral Appliance Therapy
			p An oral appliance is a mouthpiece device designed to improve the positioning of your jaw and tongue to open and prevent collapse of your upper airway.  Several other common names for oral appliance devices are mandibular advancement devices or mandibular advancement splints.
			p The most common mechanism is to hold your lower jaw in a more anterior position. This positioning expands the airway laterally and through forward movement of the tongue and tongue base.
			p Let us begin by purchasing an oral appliance therapy device.
			p We recommend the 
				a(href="https://www.vitalsleep.com/?rfsn=6954321.815dbd2") Vital Sleep 
				| or 
				a(href="https://apnearx.com/") ApneaRx 
				| or 
				a(href="https://www.snorerx.com/") SnoreRx.
			p Goal: Purchase and fit oral appliance device to begin to feel comfortable using at night.
			p We will combine the oral appliance with an adjustment to your sleep position.
			p.red *Potential side effects of an oral appliance over time are possible jaw pain or misalignment of your bite. Thus, it is important to monitor these factors with a dentist. 
			h3 Sleep Position
			p The optimal position for treating your mild obstructive sleep apnea is a side sleeping position. You may also choose a face down sleep position but need to ensure the pillow or sheets do not obstruct your mouth or nose.
			p
				strong Avoid sleeping on your back!
			p Why?
			p Remember, obstructive sleep apnea is caused by an obstruction of airflow through your nose and throat traveling to your lungs. Sleeping on your back promotes structures in your mouth and throat to drop into the airway and contribute to the blockage of air.
			h3 Treatment Options
			p The simplest way to avoid sleeping on your back may be with a more comfortable pillow designed to promote sleeping on your side. Additionally, placing an extra pillow alongside your back may be all that is necessary to help you maintain a side sleeping position.
			p If you need a pillow, we recommend the 
				a(href="https://amzn.to/3gHQcvP") Eli &amp; Elm Ultimate Side Sleep Pillow
				| or the 
				a(href="https://amzn.to/3SNV3ZL") Beckham Hotel Collection Pillows
			h3 OSA Precautions
			p You should not drive or pilot any vehicle, heavy machinery or other mode of transportation until your sleep apnea is adequately treated.
			p You must discuss your sleep apnea diagnosis with any surgeon and anesthesiologist prior to undergoing any procedure or intervention.
			p You should avoid the use of any narcotics or sedatives.
